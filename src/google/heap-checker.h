// Heap memory leak checker (utilizes heap-profiler and pprof).

// TODO(jandrews): rewrite this documentation
// HeapLeakChecker, a heap memory leak checking class.
//
// Verifies that there are no memory leaks between its
// construction and call to its *NoLeaks() or *SameHeap() member.
//
// It will dump two profiles at these two events
// (named <prefix>.<name>-beg.heap and <prefix>.<name>-end.heap
//  where <prefix> is determined automatically to some temporary location
//  and <name> is given in the HeapLeakChecker's constructor)
// and will return false in case the amount of in-use memory
// is more at the time of *NoLeaks() call than
// (or respectively differs at the time of *SameHeap() from)
// what it was at the time of our construction.
// It will also in this case print a message on how to process the dumped
// profiles to locate leaks.
//
// GUIDELINE: In addition to the local heap leak checking between two arbitrary
// points in program's execution via an explicit HeapLeakChecker object,
// we provide a way for overall whole-program heap leak checking,
// which is WHAT ONE SHOULD NORMALLY USE.
//
// Currently supported heap-check types, from less strict to more
// strict, are:
//     "minimal", "normal", "strict", "draconian"
//
// There are also two more types: "as-is" and "local".
//
// GUIDELINE CONT.: Depending on the value of the HEAPCHECK variable
// -- as well as other flags of this module -- different modifications
// of leak checking between different points in program's execution
// take place.  The "as-is" value leaves control to the other flags of
// this module.  The "local" value does not start whole-program heap
// leak checking but activates all the machinery needed for local heap
// leak checking via explicitly created HeapLeakChecker objects.
//
// For the case of "normal" everything from before execution of all
// global variable constructors to normal program exit (namely after
// main() returns and after all REGISTER_HEAPCHECK_CLEANUP's are
// executed, but before any global variable destructors are executed)
// is checked for the absence of heap memory leaks.
//
// NOTE: For all but "draconian" whole-program leak check we also
// ignore all heap objects reachable (a the time of the check)
// from any global variable or any live thread stack variable
// or from any object identified by a HeapLeakChecker::IgnoreObject() call.
//
// CAVEAT: We do a liveness flood by traversing pointers to heap objects
// starting from some initial memory regions we know to potentially
// contain live pointer data.
// -- It might potentially not find some (global)
//    live data region to start the flood from,
//    but we consider such cases to be our bugs to fix.
// The liveness flood approach although not being very portable
// and 100% exact works in most cases (see below)
// and saves us from writing a lot of explicit clean up code
// and other hassles when dealing with thread data.
//
// The liveness flood simply attempts to treat any properly aligned
// byte sequences as pointers to heap objects and thinks that
// it found a good pointer simply when the current heap memory map
// contains an object with the address whose byte representation we found.
// As a result of this simple approach, it's unlikely but very possible
// for the flood to be inexact and occasionally result in leaked objects
// being erroneously determined to be live.
// Numerous reasons can lead to this, e.g.:
// - Random bit patters can happen to look
//   like pointers to leaked heap objects.
// - Stale pointer data not corresponding to any live program variables
//   can be still present in memory regions (e.g. thread stacks --see below)
//   that we consider to be live.
// - Stale pointer data that we did not clear can point
//   to a now leaked heap object simply because the heap object
//   address got reused by the memory allocator, e.g.
//     char* p = new char[1];
//     delete p;
//     new char[1];  // this is leaked but p might be pointing to it
//
// The implications of these imprecisions of the liveness flood
// are as follows:
// - For any heap leak check we might miss some memory leaks.
// - For a whole-program leak check, a leak report *does* always
//   correspond to a real leak (unless of course the heap-checker has a bug).
//   This is because in this case we start with an empty heap profile,
//   so there's never an issue of it saying that some heap objects
//   are live when they are not.
// - For local leak checks, a leak report can be a partial false positive
//   in the sense that the reported leaks might have actually occurred
//   before this local leak check was started.
//   Here's an example scenario: When we start a local check
//   heap profile snapshot mistakenly says that some previously
//   leaked objects are live.
//   When we end the local check the heap profile snapshot now correctly
//   determines that those objects are unreachable and reports them as leaks
//   for this leak check, whereas they had been already leaked before it.
//
// THREADS and heap leak checking: At the time of HeapLeakChecker's
// construction and during *NoLeaks()/*SameHeap() calls we grab a lock so that
// heap activity in other threads is paused for the time
// we are recording or analyzing the state of the heap.
// For any heap leak check it is possible to have
// other threads active and working with the heap
// when we make the HeapLeakChecker object or do its leak checking
// provided all these threads are discoverable with the implemetation
// of thread_lister.h (e.g. are linux pthreads).
// In this case leak checking should deterministically work fine.
//
// CAVEAT: Thread stack data ignoring (via thread_lister.h)
// does not work if the program is running under gdb, probably becauce the
// ptrace functionality needed for thread_lister is already hooked to by gdb.
//
// As mentioned above thread stack liveness determination
// might miss-classify objects that very recently became unreachable (leaked)
// as reachable in the cases when the values of the pointers
// to the now unreachable objects are still present in the active stack frames,
// while the pointers actually no longer correspond to any live program
// variables.
// For this reason trivial code like the following
// might not produce the expected leak checking outcome
// depending on how the compiled code works with the stack:
//
//   int* foo = new int [20];
//   HeapLeakChecker check("a_check");
//   foo = NULL;
//   CHECK(check.NoLeaks());  // this might succeed
//
// HINT: If you are debugging detected leaks, you can try different
// (e.g. less strict) values for HEAPCHECK to determine the cause of
// the reported leaks (see the code of
// HeapLeakChecker::InternalInitStart for details).
//
// GUIDELINE: Below are the preferred ways of making your (test)
// binary pass the above recommended overall heap leak check in the
// order of decreasing preference:
//
// 1. Fix the leaks if they are real leaks.
//
// 2. If you are sure that the reported leaks are not dangerous
//    and there is no good way to fix them, then you can use
//    HeapLeakChecker::DisableChecks(Up|In|At) calls (see below) in
//    the relevant modules to disable certain stack traces for the
//    purpose of leak checking.  You can also use
//    HeapLeakChecker::IgnoreObject() call to ignore certain leaked
//    heap objects and everythign reachable from them.
//
// 3. If the leaks are due to some initialization in a third-party
//    package, you might be able to force that initialization before
//    the heap checking starts.
//
//    I.e. if HEAPCHECK == "minimal" or less strict, if you put the
//    initialization in a global constructor the heap-checker will
//    ignore it.  If HEAPCHECK == "normal" or stricter, only
//    HeapLeakChecker::LibCPreallocate() happens before heap checking
//    starts.
//
// Making a binary pass at "strict" or "draconian" level is not
// necessary or even desirable in the numerous cases when it requires
// adding a lot of (otherwise unused) heap cleanup code to various
// core libraries.
//
// NOTE: the following should apply only if
//       HEAPCHECK == "strict" or stricter
//
// 4. If the found leaks are due to incomplete cleanup in destructors
//    of global variables, extend or add those destructors or use a
//    REGISTER_HEAPCHECK_CLEANUP to do the deallocations instead to
//    avoid cleanup overhead during normal execution.  This type of
//    leaks get reported when one goes from "normal" to "strict"
//    checking.
//
// NOTE: the following should apply only if
//       HEAPCHECK == "draconian" or stricter
//
// 5. If the found leaks are for global static pointers whose values are
//    allocated/grown (e.g on-demand) and never deallocated,
//    then you should be able to add REGISTER_HEAPCHECK_CLEANUP's
//    or appropriate destructors into these modules
//    to free those objects.
//
// Example of local usage (anywhere in the program):
//
//   HeapLeakChecker heap_checker("test_foo");
//
//   { <code that exercises some foo functionality
//      that should preserve memory allocation state> }
//
//   CHECK(heap_checker.SameHeap());
//
// NOTE: One should set HEAPCHECK to a non-empty value e.g. "local"
// to help suppress some false leaks for these local checks.
