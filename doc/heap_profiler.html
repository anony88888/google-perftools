<h1>Profiling heap usage</h1>

This document describes how to profile the heap usage of a Google3 C++
program.  This facility can be useful for
<ul>
<li> Figuring out what is in the program heap at any given time
<li> Locating and automatically detecting memory leaks
<li> Finding places that do a lot of allocation
</ul>

<h2>Turning On Heap-Profiling</h2>

<p>
Start your program with the <code>--heap_profile=&lt;prefix&gt;</code>
command-line flag.

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
<li> <p>
     Heap profiling can only be used with programs that are
     using either the <a href="../../designdocs/tcmalloc/tcmalloc.html">
     tcmalloc</a> library, or Google's <code>debugallocation</code>
     library.  The vast majority of Google3 programs fall into this
     category.  If you have a program that is using a different
     malloc library (perhaps the glibc malloc library), you will
     have to edit the <code>BUILD</code> file and remove the
     <code>malloc = &lt;lib&gt;</code> rule for the program.

<li> <p>
     If the program linked in a library that was not compiled
     with enough symbolic information, all samples associated
     with the library may be charged to the last symbol found
     in the program before the libary.  This will artificially
     inflate the count for that symbol.

<li> <p>
     If you run the program on one machine, and profile it on another,
     and the shared libraries are different on the two machines, the
     profiling output may be confusing: samples that fall within
     the shared libaries may be assigned to arbitrary procedures.

<li> <p>
     Several places in the Google code-base do their own memory
     management.  If the profile shows strange allocation patterns in
     the DataBuffer code, you may want to uncomment
     <code>HEAP_PROFILE</code> in <code>google3/iobuffer/databuffer.cc</code>
     to turn-off DataBuffer free-list management code.

     <p>
     Similarly, if your program makes significant use of STL, you may
     want to force STL to use the system allocator.  This is already
     the default for most google3 programs, but may be different if
     you are using a non-standard compiler or build setup.

     <p>
     To do this when building with gcc-3.3.3, just
     set the environment variable GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1, 
     e.g. <code>export GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW=1</code>,
     before running your program.  
     (In gcc-3.4.0, the variable to set is GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW.)

     <p>
     To do this when building with gcc2, uncomment <code>HEAP_PROFILE</code> in
     <code>google3/third_party/stl/gcc2/stl_alloc.h</code>,
     and do a <code>make clean</code>.  

</ul>

<h2>Extracting a profile</h2>

If heap-profiling is turned on in a program, the program will periodically
write profiles to the filesystem.  The sequence of profiles will be named:
<pre>
           &lt;prefix&gt;.0000.heap
           &lt;prefix&gt;.0001.heap
           &lt;prefix&gt;.0002.heap
           ...
</pre>
where <code>&lt;prefix&gt;</code> is the value supplied for the
<code>--heap_profile</code> flag.  Note that if the supplied prefix
does not start with a <code>/</code>, the profile files will be
written to the program's working directory.

<p>
By default, a new profile file is written after every 1GB of
allocation.  The profile-writing interval can be adjusted by setting
the command-line flag <code>--heap_profile_allocation_interval</code>
to a numeric value that indicates the number of bytes of allocation
between each profile dump.

<p>
If the program you are profiling is a Google2 server on which
heap-profiling has been turned on, you can also telnet to it at any
time and send it the "v hidden-heap" command.  The resulting output is
the heap profile.  If the server has an HTTP interface built using the
Google2 RPC infrastructure, you can fetch the heap profile by
asking for the URL
<code>http://server:port/varz?var=hidden-heap</code>

<p>
You can also generate profiles from specific points in the program
by inserting a call to <code>HeapProfile()</code>.  Example:
<pre>
    extern const char* HeapProfile();
    const char* profile = HeapProfile();
    fputs(profile, stdout);
    free(const_cast&lt;char*&gt;(profile));
</pre>

<h2>What is profiled</h2>

The profiling system instruments all allocations and frees.  It keeps
track of various pieces of information per allocation site.  An
allocation site is defined as the active stack trace at the call to
<code>malloc</code>, <code>calloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>, or,
<code>new</code>.

<h2>Automatic leaks checking support</h2>

The profiling system provides a way to automatically check for heap
memory leaks from your code.  This is typically very useful in
unittests and regression tests.

<p>
The easiest (and the preferred) way to enable end-to-end leaks checking
(from right after <code>InitGoogle</code> to right before program exit)
in your Google3 test or regular binary is to add a dependency on
<code>//base:heapcheck</code> for it.
Alternatively you can e.g. set
<code>FLAGS_heap_check = "normal";</code>
before <code>InitGoogle</code> call.

<p>
If you need a more localized heap leaks check, here is an example:
The following code will
die if <code>Foo()</code> leaks any memory
(i.e. it allocates memory that is not freed by the time it returns):
<pre>
    HeapProfileLeakChecker checker("foo");
    Foo();
    CHECK(checker.NoLeaks());
</pre>
When the <code>checker</code> object is allocated, it creates
one heap profile.  When <code>checker.NoLeaks()</code> is invoked,
it creates another heap profile and compares it to the previously
created profile.  If the new profile indicates memory growth
(or any memory allocation change if one
 uses <code>checker.SameHeap()</code> instead),
<code>NoLeaks()</code> will return false and the program will
abort.  An error message will also be printed out saying how
<code>pprof</code> command can be run to get a detailed
analysis of the actual leaks.

<p>
In the case of localized leaks checking
you must enable heap profiling to activate leaks checking,
for example, by adding <code>FLAGS_heap_profile = "tmpdir/foo";</code>
before <code>InitGoogle</code> call
or by calling <code>HeapProfilerStart("tmpdir/foo")</code>.

<p>
On the way of making and keeping Google's code leak free,
please make the effort to fix discovered (pseudo) leaks properly.
That is, fix the leaks in the libraries and add appropriate
<code>REGISTER_HEAPCHECK_CLEANUP</code> code
so that end-to-end leaks checking works,
instead of just making your test succeed with the least effort possible.

<p>
See the comments for <code>HeapProfileLeakChecker</code> class
in <code>heap-checker.h</code> and the code in
<code>heap-checker_unittest.cc</code>
for more information and examples.

<h2>Interpreting the profile</h2>

The profile output can be viewed by passing it to the
<code>pprof</code> tool.  The <code>pprof</code> tool can print both
CPU usage and heap usage information.  It is documented in detail
on the <a href="cpuprofile.html">CPU Profiling</a> page.

<p>
Here are some examples.  These examples assume the binary is named
<code>gfs_master</code>, and a sequence of heap profile files can be
found in files named:
<pre>
  profile.0001.heap
  profile.0002.heap
  ...
  profile.0100.heap
</pre>

<h3>Why is a process so big</h3>

<pre>
    % /home/build/google3/perftools/pprof --gv bin/gfs_master profile.0100.heap
</pre>

This command will pop-up a <code>gv</code> window that displays
the profile information as a directed graph.  Here is a portion
of the resulting output:

<p>
<center>
<img src="heap-example1.png">
</center>
</p>

A few explanations:
<ul>
<li> <code>GFS_MasterChunk::AddServer</code> accounts for 255.6 MB
     of the live memory, which is 25% of the total live memory.
<li> <code>GFS_MasterChunkTable::UpdateState</code> is directly
     accountable for 176.2 MB of the live memory (i.e., it directly
     allocated 176.2 MB that has not been freed yet).  Furthermore,
     it and its callees are responsible for 729.9 MB.  The
     labels on the outgoing edges give a good indication of the
     amount allocated by each callee.
</ul>

<h3>Comparing Profiles</h3>

<p>
You often want to skip allocations during the initialization phase of
a program so you can find gradual memory leaks.  One simple way to do
this is to compare two profiles -- both collected after the program
has been running for a while.  Specify the name of the first profile
using the <code>--base</code> option.  Example:
<pre>
   % /home/build/google3/perftools/pprof --base=profile.0004.heap prog profile.0100.heap
</pre>

The memory-usage in <code>profile.0004.heap</code> will be subtracted from
the memory-usage in <code>profile.0100.heap</code> and the result will
be displayed.

<h3>Text display</h3>

<pre>
% /home/build/google3/perftools/pprof bin/gfs_master profile.0100.heap
   255.6  24.7%  24.7%    255.6  24.7% GFS_MasterChunk::AddServer
   184.6  17.8%  42.5%    298.8  28.8% GFS_MasterChunkTable::Create
   176.2  17.0%  59.5%    729.9  70.5% GFS_MasterChunkTable::UpdateState
   169.8  16.4%  75.9%    169.8  16.4% PendingClone::PendingClone
    76.3   7.4%  83.3%     76.3   7.4% __default_alloc_template::_S_chunk_alloc
    49.5   4.8%  88.0%     49.5   4.8% hashtable::resize
   ...
</pre>

<p>
<ul>
<li> The first column contains the direct memory use in MB.
<li> The fourth column contains memory use by the procedure
     and all of its callees.
<li> The second and fifth columns are just percentage representations
     of the numbers in the first and fifth columns.
<li> The third column is a cumulative sum of the second column
     (i.e., the <code>k</code>th entry in the third column is the
     sum of the first <code>k</code> entries in the second column.)
</ul>

<h3>Ignoring or focusing on specific regions</h3>

The following command will give a graphical display of a subset of
the call-graph.  Only paths in the call-graph that match the
regular expression <code>DataBuffer</code> are included:
<pre>
% /home/build/google3/perftools/pprof --gv --focus=DataBuffer bin/gfs_master profile.0100.heap
</pre>

Similarly, the following command will omit all paths subset of the
call-graph.  All paths in the call-graph that match the regular
expression <code>DataBuffer</code> are discarded:
<pre>
% /home/build/google3/perftools/pprof --gv --ignore=DataBuffer bin/gfs_master profile.0100.heap
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Total allocations + object-level information</h3>

All of the previous examples have displayed the amount of in-use
space.  I.e., the number of bytes that have been allocated but not
freed.  You can also get other types of information by supplying
a flag to <code>pprof</code>:
<p>
<center>
<table frame=box rules=sides cellpadding=5 width=100%>

<tr valign=top>
  <td><code>--inuse_space</code></td>
  <td>
     Display the number of in-use megabytes (i.e. space that has
     been allocated but not freed).  This is the default.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
  <td><code>--inuse_objects</code></td>
  <td>
     Display the number of in-use objects (i.e. number of
     objects that have been allocated but not freed).
  </td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
  <td><code>--alloc_space</code></td>
  <td>
     Display the number of allocated megabytes.  This includes
     the space that has since been de-allocated.  Use this
     if you want to find the main allocation sites in the
     program.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
  <td><code>--alloc_objects</code></td>
  <td>
     Display the number of allocated objects.  This includes
     the objects that have since been de-allocated.  Use this
     if you want to find the main allocation sites in the
     program.
  </td>
