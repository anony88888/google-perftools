<h1>TCMalloc : Thread-Caching Malloc</h1>

<address>Sanjay Ghemawat</address>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

TCMalloc is faster than the glibc malloc, ptmalloc2 and other mallocs
that I have tested.  ptmalloc2 takes approximately 300 nanoseconds to
execute a malloc/free pair on a 2.8 GHz P4 (for small objects).  The
TCMalloc implementation takes approximately 50 nanoseconds for the
same operation pair.  Speed is important for a malloc implementation
because if malloc is not fast enough, application writers are inclined
to write their own custom free lists on top of malloc.  This can lead
to extra complexity, and more memory usage unless the application
writer is very careful to appropriately size the free lists and
scavenge idle objects out of the free list

<p>
TCMalloc also reduces lock contention for multi-threaded programs.
For small objects, there is virtually zero contention.  For large
objects, TCMalloc tries to use fine grained and efficient spinlocks.
ptmalloc2 also reduces lock contention by using per-thread arenas but
there is a big problem with ptmalloc2's use of per-thread arenas.  In
ptmalloc2 memory can never move from one arena to another.  This can
lead to huge amounts of wasted space.  For example, in one of the
MapReduce operations used by the segment-indexer, the map phase would
allocate approximately 300MB of memory for URL canonicalization data
structures.  When the map phase finished, another map phase would be
started in the same address space.  If this map phase was assigned a
different arena than the one used by the first phase, this phase would
not reuse any of the memory left after the first phase and would add
another 300MB to the address space.  Similar memory blowup problems
were also noticed in <code>gfs_chunkserver</code>.

<p>
Another benefit of TCMalloc is space-efficient representation of small
objects.  For example, N 8-byte objects can be allocated while using
space approximately <code>8N * 1.01</code> bytes.  I.e., a one-percent
space overhead.  ptmalloc2 uses a four-byte header for each object and
(I think) rounds up the size to a multiple of 8 bytes and ends up
using <code>16N</code> bytes.

<h2>Overview</h2>

TCMalloc assigns each thread a thread-local cache.  Small allocations
are satisfied from the thread-local cache.  Objects are moved from
central data structures into a thread-local cache as needed, and
periodic garbage collections are used to migrate memory back from a
thread-local cache into the central data structures.

<p>
TCMalloc treates objects with size &lt;= 32K ("small" objects)
differently from larger objects.  Large objects are allocated
directly from the central heap using a page-level allocator
(a page is a 4K aligned region of memory).  I.e., a large object
is always page-aligned and occupies an integral number of pages.

<p>
A run of pages can be carved up into a sequence of small objects, each
equally sized.  For example a run of one page (4K) can be carved up
into 32 objects of size 128 bytes each.

<h2>Small Object Allocation</h2>

Each small object size maps to one of approximately 170 allocatable
size-classes.  For example, all allocations in the range 961 to 1024
bytes are rounded up to 1024.  The size-classes are spaced so that
small sizes are separated by 8 bytes, larger sizes by 16 bytes, even
larger sizes by 32 bytes, and so forth.  The maximal spacing (for sizes
>= ~2K) is 256 bytes.

<p>
A thread cache contains a singly linked list of free objects per size-class.
<center><img src="threadheap.gif"></center>

When allocating a small object: (1) We map its size to the
corresponding size-class.  (2) Look in the corresponding free list in
the thread cache for the current thread.  (3) If the free list is not
empty, we remove the first object from the list and return it.  When
following this fast path, TCMalloc acquires no locks at all.  This
helps speed-up allocation significantly because a lock/unlock pair
takes approximately 100 nanoseconds on a 2.8 GHz Xeon.

<p>
If the free list is empty: (1) We fetch a bunch of objects from a
central free list for this size-class (the central free list is shared
by all threads).  (2) Place them in the thread-local free list.  (3)
Return one of the newly fetched objects to the applications.

<p>
If the central free list is also empty: (1) We allocate a run of pages
from the central page allocator.  (2) Split the run into a set of
objects of this size-class.  (3) Place the new objects on the central
free list.  (4) As before, move some of these objects to the
thread-local free list.

<h2>Large Object Allocation</h2>

A large object size (&gt; 32K) is rounded up to a page size (4K) and
is handled by a central page heap.  The central page heap is again an
array of free lists.  For <code>i &lt; 256</code>, the
<code>k</code>th entry is a free list of runs that consist of
<code>k</code> pages.  The <code>256</code>th entry is a free list of
runs that have length <code>&gt;= 256</code> pages: 
<center><img src="pageheap.gif"></center>

<p>
An allocation for <code>k</code> pages is satisfied by looking in the
<code>k</code>th free list.  If that free list is empty, we look in
the next free list, and so forth.  Eventually, we look in the last
free list if necessary.  If that fails, we fetch memory from the
system (using sbrk, mmap, or by mapping in portions of /dev/mem).

<p>
If an allocation for <code>k</code> pages is satisfied by a run
of pages of length &gt; <code>k</code>, the remainder of the
run is re-inserted back into the appropriate free list in the
page heap.

<h2>Spans</h2>

The heap managed by TCMalloc consists of a set of pages.  A run of
contiguous pages is represented by a <code>Span</code> object.  A span
can either be <em>allocated</em>, or <em>free</em>.  If free, the span
is one of the entries in a page heap linked-list.  If allocated, it is
either a large object that has been handed off to the application, or
a run of pages that have been split up into a sequence of small
objects.  If split into small objects, the size-class of the objects
is recorded in the span.

<p>
A central array indexed by page number can be used to find the span to
which a page belongs.  For example, span <em>a</em> below occupies 2
pages, span <em>b</em> occupies 1 page, span <em>c</em> occupies 5
pages and span <em>d</em> occupies 3 pages.
<center><img src="spanmap.gif"></center>
A 32-bit address space can fit 2^20 4K pages, so this central array
takes 4MB of space, which seems acceptable.  On 64-bit machines, we
use a 3-level radix tree instead of an array to map from a page number
to the corresponding span pointer.

<h2>Deallocation</h2>

When an object is deallocated, we compute its page number and look it up
in the central array to find the corresponding span object.  The span tells
us whether or not the object is small, and its size-class if it is
small.  If the object is small, we insert it into the appropriate free
list in the current thread's thread cache.  If the thread cache now
exceeds a predetermined size (2MB by default), we run a garbage
collector that moves unused objects from the thread cache into central
free lists.

<p>
If the object is large, the span tells us the range of pages covered
by the object.  Suppose this range is <code>[p,q]</code>.  We also
lookup the spans for pages <code>p-1</code> and <code>q+1</code>.  If
either of these neighboring spans are free, we coalesce them with the
<code>[p,q]</code> span.  The resulting span is inserted into the
appropriate free list in the page heap.

<h2>Central Free Lists for Small Objects</h2>

As mentioned before, we keep a central free list for each size-class.
Each central free list is organized as a two-level data structure:
a set of spans, and a linked list of free objects per span.

<p>
An object is allocated from a central free list by removing the
first entry from the linked list of some span.  (If all spans
have empty linked lists, a suitably sized span is first allocated
from the central page heap.)

<p>
An object is returned to a central free list by adding it to the
linked list of its containing span.  If the linked list length now
equals the total number of small objects in the span, this span is now
completely free and is returned to the page heap.

<h2>Garbage Collection of Thread Caches</h2>

A thread cache is garbage collected when the combined size of all
objects in the cache exceeds 2MB.  The garbage collection threshold
is automatically decreased as the number of threads increases so that
we don't waste an inordinate amount of memory in a program with lots
of threads.

<p>
We walk over all free lists in the cache and move some number of
objects from the free list to the corresponding central list.

<p>
The number of objects to be moved from a free list is determined using
a per-list low-water-mark <code>L</code>.  <code>L</code> records the
minimum length of the list since the last garbage collection.  Note
that we could have shortened the list by <code>L</code> objects at the
last garbage collection without requiring any extra accesses to the
central list.  We use this past history as a predictor of future
accesses and move <code>L/2</code> objects from the thread cache free
list to the corresponding central free list.  This algorithm has the
nice property that if a thread stops using a particular size, all
objects of that size will quickly move from the thread cache to the
central free list where they can be used by other threads.

<h2>Caveats</h2>

TCMalloc may be somewhat more memory hungry than other mallocs, (but
tends not to have the huge blowups that can happen with other
mallocs).  In particular, at startup TCMalloc allocates approximately
6 MB of memory.  It would be easy to roll a specialized version
that trades-off a little bit of speed for more space efficiency.

<p>
TCMalloc currently does not return any memory to the system.

<p>
Don't try to load TCMalloc into a running binary (e.g., using
JNI in Java programs).  The binary will have allocated some
objects using the system malloc, and may try to pass them
to TCMalloc for deallocation.  TCMalloc will not be able
to handle such objects.

<h2>Performance Notes</h2>

Here is a log of some of the performance improvements seen
by switching to tcmalloc:
