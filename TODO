HEAP PROFILER

1) Fix heap profiling under STL
   * Find out how to force non-glibc STL libraries to call new() and
     delete() for every allocation / deallocation.
   * Make heap profiler ignore STL-internal allocations for those
     libraries under which we cannot profile accurately, so we only
     see object-level leaks.
2) Remove dependency on tcmalloc
3) Port to non-linux O/Ses (right now code uses /proc for library info)
4) Port to non-x86 architectures (locking code in internal_spinlock is
   x86-specific)
5) Port to C?

HEAP CHECKER

[1) Uses heap profiler, so its TODOs apply here as well]
2) Remove requirement that the heap-checker must be linked last into
   an application (hard! -- it needs its global constructor to run
   first)

TCMALLOC

1) Implement mallinfo/mallopt
2) Have tcmalloc work correctly when libpthread is not linked in
3) Return memory to the system when requirements drop
4) Explore coloring allocated objects to avoid cache conflicts
5) Explore biasing reclamation to larger addresses

STACKTRACE

1) Document and advertise libstacktrace
2) Remove dependency on linux/x86
